Setup:
- Checkout project using Git
- Download compData.db from https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B-TrMT6ioVZCQ2g4QVhTbU12NW8
- Save compData.db inside the project's Data folder

Technical Notes:
- Python 2.7
- Requires numpy and sklearn python modules. I recommend using the Anaconda python distribution which comes with these and many other useful data science packages
